        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line using an interpreter, which makes them easier to debug but slower.\n",
        "  - Compiled languages translate the entire program into machine code before execution, which makes them faster but less flexible during development.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling is a mechanism that allows a program to detect and manage runtime errors. It prevents the program from crashing and provides a way to respond gracefully when something goes wrong.\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - It contains code that must run whether an exception happens or not.\n",
        "  - It is mainly used for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "  - It ensures important final steps are executed even if the program encounters an error\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging is the process of recording important information, events, or errors that happen while a program runs. It helps developers debug issues, track program flow, and maintain records.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The _del_ method is a destructor that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to release resources or perform final cleanup operations.\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - When we use import module, we bring the whole module into our program, so we have to use the module’s name every time we call something from it, like math.sqrt(). But when we use from module import name, we pick only the specific function or class we need, and we can use it directly without the module name. The first way is safer because it avoids name clashes, while the second way makes the code cleaner and easier to write.\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - We handle multiple exceptions by using several except blocks, each meant for a different type of error. This way, your program can respond differently depending on what went wrong. You can also catch a group of errors in a single block by putting them inside a tuple. This makes the program safer and prevents it from crashing unexpectedly.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - The with statement makes file handling easier and safer because it automatically opens and closes the file for you. Even if an error happens while reading or writing, the file will still close properly. This helps avoid problems like data not saving or files getting corrupted.\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading means running multiple threads within the same program, where all threads share the same memory. It works best for tasks that spend a lot of time waiting, like reading files or downloading data.\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing uses separate processes that don't share memory and actually run in parallel on multiple CPU cores. This makes multiprocessing more suitable for heavy, CPU-intensive tasks where real parallel execution is needed.\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Logging is useful because it keeps track of what your program is doing. It records errors, warnings, and important events, which makes debugging much easier. It also helps monitor how the program runs over time, especially in large or long-running applications.\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is the system that handles how memory is given to and taken back from your program. Python manages most of this automatically through its memory manager and garbage collector, so you don’t have to do it manually.\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python follows a simple flow: you put risky code inside a try block, and if something goes wrong, Python jumps to the matching except block. If no error occurs, an optional else block can run, and finally, the finally block runs at the end no matter what.\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management is important because it prevents your program from wasting memory or crashing. Good memory handling helps programs run smoothly, use system resources efficiently, and avoid slowing down over time.\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The try block is where you write the code that might cause an error. The except block tells Python what to do if that error happens. Instead of the program stopping or crashing, the except block handles the mistake and lets the program continue safely.\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Python's garbage collector automatically removes objects that are no longer needed. It mainly uses reference counting, which tracks how many variables refer to an object. When that count becomes zero, Python deletes the object. It also checks for circular references to clean up memory properly.\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The else block runs only when the code in the try block has no errors. It's a good place to write the code that should run only if everything worked perfectly. This helps keep the program neat by separating “what to do if things go right” from “what to do if something goes wrong.”\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  - The common logging levels in Python are\n",
        "     - DEBUG - used for very detailed information, mostly for developers.\n",
        "     - INFO - shows normal messages that confirm things are working.\n",
        "     - WARNING - tells that something might become a problem.\n",
        "     - ERROR - shows that something has gone wrong in the program.\n",
        "     - CRITICAL - shows a very serious error that may stop the program.\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  - os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current one, but it works only on Unix-based systems. The multiprocessing module, however, works on all platforms and provides a safer and more convenient way to create and manage multiple processes.\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - Closing a file is important because it ensures all data is saved properly and system resources are freed. If files stay open, they can cause errors, data loss, or memory leaks, especially in big programs.\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - file.read() reads the entire file or a large chunk at once, while file.readline() reads just one line at a time. This makes readline() better for handling big files because it doesn't load everything into memory at once.\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - The logging module helps programmers record important information while the program runs. It allows logs to be written to the screen, files, or other places, making it easy to track errors and understand program behavior.\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  - The os module helps Python talk to the operating system. In file handling, it is used to do things like create folders, delete files, rename files, check if a file exists, and move around inside different directories. It basically lets your Python program manage files and folders just like you do manually on your computer.\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Some challenges include handling circular references, managing large amounts of data, and ensuring that objects are freed on time. In long-running programs, poor memory management can slow things down or even cause crashes.\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "  - To raise an exception manually in Python, we use the raise keyword followed by the type of exception we want to create. This allows us to stop the program when an invalid or unexpected situation occurs.\n",
        "  - For example-  raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\").\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - Multithreading allows a program to do multiple tasks at the same time.\n",
        "  - It is especially useful for tasks that spend time waiting, like downloading files or reading data.\n",
        "  - It makes applications faster and more responsive for the user.\n",
        "  - It helps use computer resources more efficiently.\n",
        "  - It is useful in programs that handle many users or many operations at once."
